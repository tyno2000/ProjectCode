# ProjectCode
First, connect the sensor to the RPI using 3 female to female jumper wires:
- The first pin of the sensor connect to the first pin of the RPI
- The second pin of the sensor connect to the seventh pin of the RPI (You may need to use a resistor for the sensor to 
work, mine has a build-in resistor)
- The third pin of the sensor connect to the sixth pin of the RPI
Connect the RPI to a power source
